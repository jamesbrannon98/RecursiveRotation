# RecursiveRotation
This is an algorithm that will recursively rotate an image using block transfer.
The file will read in the image, and perform a series of moves recursively in order to rotate the image.
While the algorithm is doing this, it is also creating a video recording of the rotation; an example image and .gif are provided in the repository.

In order to run the file, navigate to the folder the image and .py file are located in from the command line, and type:

```python Rotate.py [input.png] [output.mp4]```

Where input is the name of the input image and output is the name of the file the video will be written to. For example, using the examples I provided, I would type:

```python Rotate.py Einstein.png output.mp4```
